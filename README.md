## Build Notes (AI)

### `index.html`

I tried to build a Hua Rong Dao game (with an auto-solver) with several AIs — **DeepSeek**, **xAI**, **Google Gemini**, and **GPT-4o** — but none of them produced a version that could correctly solve the game.

When the newly published **GPT-O1** became available, it worked after several tries.

### `hua-rong-dao.html`

This is a newer one-file implementation. I used **GPT-5.2** and it worked in only **two tries**.
